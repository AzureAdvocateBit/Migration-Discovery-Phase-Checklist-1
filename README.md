# Migration-Discovery-Phase

A lot of organisations are discussing and actioning plans to migrate either part or all their workloads from on prem into the Cloud.  Regardless of how much you are moving or the size of your organisation everyone must start with the same common start point, a discovery. 

This [checklist](https://github.com/weeyin83/Migration-Discovery-Phase/blob/master/checklist.md) can be used as a starting point to guide you on what information you need to start to collate for your discovery phase. 

The checklist is a starting point, please feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/weeyin83/Migration-Discovery-Phase/blob/master/contributing.md) by forking this repo and issuing a pull request. I'd love the community to help grow this checklist and share their experiences.
